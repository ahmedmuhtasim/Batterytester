### This project was developed by the UVa Solar Car Team in order to test large numbers of lithium ion 18650 cells. By testing ESR and capacity one can be confident that each and every cell tested performs as expected and no cells have arrived DOA. Individually characterizing and 'binning' each cell allows us to arrange the cells in the final battery bank such that each module will have as close to identical capacity, reducing the chance of the modules SoC from drifting significantly over charge/discharge cycles. The design needed to be flexible, offer many features, be cost effective, and scalable. We are unsure of whether this design will work at the moment as no working prototype has been constructed yet, and the software devolopment has not started for it yet. We wish for everyone to have access to this design and feel free to do as they please with this work, so long as we are attributed and the project remains open.

lol nope!
